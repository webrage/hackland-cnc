# CAD
#### CAD *==> [CAM](CAM.md) ==> [MACHINE CONTROL](Machine.md)*

CAD is the process of creating 3d models for later machining.

This document discusses Fusion 360 only, although there are many other good choices available. The learning curve on 3D packages can be steep, so select one that can do all the things you need to be able to do, as you won't want to change products too often.

Fusion 360 allows for:
* parametric modeling *- so you can easily change you material size by changing one parameter for example*
* CAM - creating the gcode *(for a CNC machine)* from your model from within the same program you used to model it. You can call on the CNC Tool Library and use Setup Templates that already exist.
* Can be used for 3D printing and the Mechmate CNC machine...
* has a steep learning curve.
